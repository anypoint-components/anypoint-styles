# anypoint-styles

The `<anypoint-styles>` component provides simple ways to use Anypoint CSS styles
in an application. The following imports are available:

1.  [colors.html](colors.html):
a complete list of the colors defined in the Anypoint [palette](http://ux.mulesoft.com/#/colors)

2.  [typography.html](typography.html):
Anypoint [font](http://ux.mulesoft.com/#/typography) styles and sizes

3.  [anypoint-theme.html](anypoint-theme.html) Complete theme to style API
components according to Anypoint style guide.

We recommend importing each of these individual files, and using the style mixins
available in each ones, rather than the aggregated `anypoint-styles.html` as a whole.
